<h2>
  Hello! I’m Sarah, a 33-year-old entrepreneur currently building my own virtual
  assistance business.
</h2>
<p>
  I have a diverse educational background,having studied Administration and Data
  Science, along with Business Studies that cover areas such as business
  management, accounting, and global economics. Additionally, I’m proficient in
  Spanish, which started as a hobby and has become a valuable skill.
</p>

<p>
  My interests are varied and ever-evolving. I have a passion for learning, and
  I’m currently diving into web development. Despite being a homebody, I enjoy
  staying active and pursuing hobbies outside the home. For instance, I can
  perform hula hoop tricks similar to those seen in Cirque du Soleil shows. I
  have also been a beginner in Salsa dancing for many years, which shows my
  dedication to it despite not always being able to commit the time. In recent
  years, I’ve previously taken up indoor bouldering, preferring the safety of an
  audience over the unpredictability of the wilderness..

  I was inspired to take up Muay Thai after trying it during a trip to Thailand
  in the spring of 2022. It was challenging, and I loved the coordination of
  movements and the physical challenge it posed. Muay Thai is truly an art,
  albeit a painful one. Thailand is a beautiful place, and I was truly spoiled
  by it. Due to pandemic restrictions, tourism was low, allowing me to enjoy
  nature and attractions with my companion.

  My favorite memory from Thailand is being out in the ocean after canoeing to a
  secluded beach at dusk. As the tide went out, it became difficult to see the
  rocks, leading to a few detours. But along the way, something magical
  happened. We were casually rowing in the darkness when suddenly the water
  started glowing bright blue with each paddle stroke. We were like children,
  mesmerized and splashing away, all alone far from the shore. After that, we
  skipped any algae snorkeling that were included in boat tours, knowing nothing
  could top our previous adventure..

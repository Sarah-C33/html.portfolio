<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Ying Yang Master</h3>
<p>Great chinese fantasy period movie with misunderstood protagonist who <br />
saves everyone in the end.</p>

<h3>The 300</h3>

<p>An old favourite but it has not aged at all,<br />
it tells a story of spartans who fight against invadors<br />
even though they are extremely outnumbered.</p>

<h3>My Sisters Keeper</h3>

<p>A tear jerker and even older than the The 300,<br />
it tells the story of a young girl who was essentially a designer baby so that she could be used for stem cells, undergoing painful procedures<br />
to treat her older sister who has luekemia.</p>
